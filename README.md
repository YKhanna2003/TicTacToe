# C++ games-TicTacToe

A short game of TicTacToe coded in C++ Language. Just a few lines of code covering most of the corner or edge cases. Go ahead try them out. A makefile is attached with the Repository and you have to compile all them together using the command make main and voila run the executible by using ./tictactoe.

```bash
make main
```

```bash
./tictactoe
```

Have fun.
Cheers!
